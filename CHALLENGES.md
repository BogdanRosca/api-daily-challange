# Challenges

Newest first. Each one starts from the commit before it; fix it, commit, then ask for the next.

## 1. A contact update that loses details (contacts)

`pytest -q` has one failing test: `test_api_changing_a_contacts_email_keeps_their_other_details`.

Find out why and fix it at the root. Read the fake's docstring and the contract before you change anything.
Done when: the suite is green, `make check` is clean, and you can say in one sentence why it failed.
